C4

上下文（Context）
容器（Container）
组件（Component）
代码（Code）
To create these maps of your code, you first need a common set of abstractions to create a ubiquitous language to use to describe the static structure of a software system. The C4 model considers the static structures of a software system in terms of containers (applications, data stores, microservices, etc.), components, and code. It also considers the people who use the software systems that we build.
