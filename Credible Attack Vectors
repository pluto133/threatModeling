At some essential level, much of an architecture risk assessment (ARA) is focused as an attempt to enumerate the complete set of credible attack vectors (CAVs). If you recall from Chapter 2, 
a credible attack vector was defined as follows:

Credible attack vector: A credible threat exercising an exploit on an exposed vulnerability.

Recalling the risk term discussion from Chapter 4, a CAV encapsulates the three threat sub-terms into a single expression:

• Threat
• Exposure
• Vulnerability

Each of these terms is likewise composed of details that were explained in Chapter 4. If you don’t feel comfortable with CAV, in particular, 
and computer security risk, in general, you may want to review Chapter 4 before you proceed.

Risk is the critical governing principle that underlies the entire risk assessment and threat modeling process. Ultimately, we must mitigate 
those computer attacks that are likely to impinge upon the use of the system under assessment and upon efforts to obtain the objectives of the 
organization. As my friend, Anurag “Archie” Agrawal, says, “[threat modeling is] all about risk. . . .” Still, you will find that “risk” is not 
mentioned as much as priorities.

As you walk through the process, filtering and prioritizing, you will be calculating risk. Although a formal risk calculation can be, and often is, 
a marker of a mature security architecture practice, by itself, simply understanding the risks is only one goal for an ARA and threat model. We also 
need to know which risks can be treated and which cannot, and produce an achievable set of requirements that will get implemented. Risk is

the information that drives these decisions, but it is not the sole end result of the ATASM process. For this reason, risk calculation is built into 
the steps of ATASM and underlies much of the process, rather than being a separate and distinct calculation exercise.
